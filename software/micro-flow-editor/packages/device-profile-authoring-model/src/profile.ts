 * on `@spaghettilab/physical-composition-model`'s `ModuleNodeData`
 * (`portId`/`bayId`/`railId`/`endpoint`), never duplicated here.
 *
 * The real struct has exactly three op arrays: `init_ops`, `sample_ops`,
 * `safe_stop_ops` — no separate `event`/`command` op arrays exist, even
 * though the task text and firmware phase 325's design prose mention
 * "evento/command" as a goal. This package models only what the shipped
 * struct has; event/command acquisition plans remain a documented gap, not
 * an invented field (see this package's README).
